          <p class="p-1">I have built products for various industries, defense contracting, social gaming, internet video distribution, and e-commerce, as
          data is at the center
          machine learning, hadoop, python</p>

          <p class="p-2">There is no point in building something unless someone wants it. Better is if they need it. And even better, when a large number of people need it.</p>
          <p class="p-2">I am focused on building things that people need. Solving problems they have. Helping people get jobs done more easily. I wouldn't waste my time doing anything else.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Mining Bits</h1>
          <p class="p-3">Excited to drudge through tons of data to find a little nugget of insight. I enjoy using statistical methods to better understand the world; whether its customer behavior, gas price fluctuations, airline delays, or my own fitness metrics.</p>
          <p class="p-3">In a constant pursuit to better my decision making skills and knowledge, I am always in the search for more data and better tools. Humans are terrible at statistics, especially with large volumes of data. We have a few optimized natural methods, like visual pattern recognition, but in general our stats skills are pretty weak. I am always inclined to get machines to help with my deficiencies; that is what they were built for.</p>
          <p class="p-3">Having the right data and using it in the proper manner helps to produce better products.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Getting People to Understand</h1>
          <p class="p-4">Is a difficult problem, but having the right product can get you halfway there. I try to get the rest of the way by finding clever ways to do more with less. Searching for ways to amplify money and time to get many new customers as cheaply as possible.</p>
          <p class="p-4">Understanding the customer through running small experiments and constant iteration allows me to quickly and effectively find what works with certainty. You can only get customers to understand you after you understand them.</p>
