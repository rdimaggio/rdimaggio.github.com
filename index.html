          <h3 class="heading heading-1">Tech nerd experienced leading the creation of complex software products for companies both large and small
          </h3>
          <p class="p-1">I enjoy working on data heavy products with complex architectures and requirements. Solving large difficult problems is always fun.</p>
          <p class="p-1">I have previously built products in various industries: defense contracting, social gaming, internet video distribution, file sharing and backup, and e-commerce. A disparate list, but the key theme is they all have a very data heavy component.
          </p>
          <p class="p-1">I enjoy taking my skillset to new areas and applying it in new ways. I'm always interested in taking the road less traveled.</p>

          <h1 class="heading heading-2">Creating Value</h1>
          <p class="p-2">There is no point in building something unless someone wants it. Better is if they need it. And even better, when a large number of people need it.</p>
          <p class="p-2">I am focused on building things people need, solving real problems they have, and helping people get jobs done easier. I wouldn't waste my time doing anything else.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Mining Bits</h1>
          <p class="p-3">Excited to drudge through tons of data to find a little nugget of insight. I enjoy using statistical methods to better understand the world; whether its customer behavior, gas price fluctuations, airline delays, or my own fitness metrics.</p>
          <p class="p-3">In a constant pursuit to better my decision making skills and knowledge, I am always in the search for more data and better tools. Humans are terrible at statistics, especially with large volumes of data. We have a few optimized natural methods, like visual pattern recognition, but in general our stats skills are pretty weak. I am always inclined to get machines to help with my deficiencies; that is what they were built for.</p>
          <p class="p-3">Having the right data and using it in the proper manner helps to produce better products.</p>

          <h1 class="heading">Getting People to Understand</h1>
          <p class="p-4">Is a difficult problem, but having the right product can get you halfway there. I try to get the rest of the way by finding clever ways to do more with less. Searching for ways to amplify money and time to get many new customers as cheaply as possible.</p>
          <p class="p-4">Understanding the customer through running small experiments and constant iteration allows me to quickly and effectively find what works with certainty. You can only get customers to understand you after you understand them.</p>
